This is some work for a front-end UI to access a database I've been helping to develop for a Capstone project. 
Front-end is built using Boostrap, including HTML, and CSS
The data in the table in the html file is just sample data for testing purposes, and is not connected to the database.
HTML file refers to a CSS file for customized scroll-bars.
